#The run_analysis.R script performs the following steps:
#Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
#Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
#Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
#Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
